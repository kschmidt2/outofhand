      <span class="dropcap">O</span>n July 18, 1995, seven-year-old Jeffrey Moon dialed 911 to report that his parents were engaged in a violent altercation. His mother, Felicia Moon, told police when they arrived that her husband had slapped her, choked her, and engaged her in a high-speed car chase.  Three days later, during a joint press conference in the couple’s home, his father, Warren Moon, then the starting quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings and the NFL’s Man of the Year in 1989, admitted he had made a “terrible mistake”.  Later that day, Warren Moon was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault. Over the next several months, Felicia pleaded for him not to be prosecuted. Warren claimed that this was not a case of domestic violence but rather a "domestic dispute" that had gotten out of hand.<br /><br />
      In many ways, this played out like a typical case of domestic violence in America, where approximately 1.3 million women and 835,000 men are physically assaulted by an intimate partner each year, according to the Department of Justice.  What made this different, however, was Warren Moon’s hero status in Houston, where he played quarterback for the Oilers for ten seasons and was known for his charity work. As William Nack and Lester Munson wrote in Sports Illustrated the week following the arrest: <br /><br />
      <i>"There is no telling the outcome. Warren is a folk hero in Houston, a doer of good works – and this, after all, is a case of domestic violence. A neck-wringing minimized as a "domestic dispute." An assault masquerading as an argument. A crime perceived and treated like no other in America, especially, it seems, when it is committed by an athlete."</i><br /><br />
      On February 23, 1996, Warren Moon was acquitted. It took the jury less than half an hour to reach a decision.<br /><br />

      <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">Domestic violence in the United States</h3>
      <span class="dropcap">I</span>t’s difficult to provide accurate statistics on domestic violence, as it is estimated that only one in ten incidents is reported.  Domestic violence is the single major cause of injury to women  and of all the women murdered in 2010, approximately 40 percent were killed by a spouse or someone they were dating, compared to 2 to 3 percent for men.  Domestic violence injuries are more common for women than injuries from auto accidents, muggings, and rapes combined.  Notoriously difficult to prosecute in court, many victims in domestic violence cases choose not to testify for various reasons, including fear of retribution from the abuser. Additionally, because attackers have an intimate relationship with their victims, they have an advantage other criminals don’t in that they are able to appeal for sympathy from the public, the criminal justice system, and the jury. This is especially true for professional athletes. In 1995, domestic violence cases involving professional athletes resulted in a 35 percent conviction rate, compared to 77 percent for the general population. <br /><br />

      <h3>A brief history of domestic violence in the NFL</h3>
      <span class="dropcap">T</span>he National Football League in particular has had a long history of domestic violence. In the 1990s, the high-profile cases of Moon and O.J. Simpson led then-Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to adopt the Personal Conduct Policy in 1997, the first of its kind in professional sports. The policy stated:<br /><br />
      <i>“the Commissioner will have the right . . . to fine . . . to suspend . . . and/or to terminate this contract” if the player is “guilty of any . . . form of conduct reasonably judged by the League Commissioner to be detrimental to the League or professional football.”</i><br /><br />
      Recently, two high-profile players have been suspended for domestic violence by current Commissioner Roger Goodell under an updated version of this policy – running back Ray Rice, formerly of the Baltimore Ravens, and defensive end Greg Hardy, who played with the Dallas Cowboys during the 2015 season. This website looks at the cases of these two players in order to analyze the way sports media cover domestic violence committed by professional football players. By looking at the ways in which the media covers domestic violence in the NFL, I hope to bring forward a discussion of how media influences the way Americans view domestic violence throughout our society.<br /><br />
      View the timelines to see how three outlets — ESPN, Sports Illustrated and Deadspin — covered the events in the Rice and Hardy cases. Below is my conclusion based on the research I did in tracking this coverage.<br /><br />

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <span class="dropcap">O</span>verall, the coverage of the Ray Rice and Greg Hardy cases was different from what I had anticipated based on previous studies of the media’s coverage of domestic violence. Other than a few examples – most notably when Sports Illustrated mentioned Nicole Holder’s admitted cocaine use in the coverage of her testimony – there was little victim blaming and most of the coverage focused on the wrongdoing of the abuser. Perhaps the reason for this is that both cases featured overwhelming evidence of the attack in the form of videos or photos. My assumption is that the coverage of the Rice incident would have looked significantly different if the attack had taken place in their home with no footage or witnesses to back up Janay’s story.<br /><br />
    	The difference in coverage between the three media outlets was not unexpected. Deadspin was the most blunt in its coverage and the most apt and willing to call out entities for wrongdoing throughout both cases. The alternative blog site was also a source of primary information when it obtained the Hardy photos and court documents and released them to the public. Sports Illustrated was surprisingly critical of the NFL, the Cowboys, and the Ravens, and really drove its point home with its cover story on September 15, 2014 that called out the NFL and the Ravens for their mishandling of the Rice incident, going so far as to say they should both be embarrassed by the way it was handled. ESPN most often wrote straight news stories without any obvious biases. However, they often left out important details – such as Hardy having already been convicted of domestic assault in court, or former FBI director Robert S. Mueller having ties to the NFL – and chose to include quotes that portrayed the actors involved in each incident in a positive light, while leaving out quotes that would make them look bad. For instance, after the Rice’s press conference, ESPN was the only of the three outlets to not publish Ray’s “sometimes in life, you get knocked down” quote. This is not surprising as while ESPN is a journalistic entity covering sports, they make their big money from broadcasting those same sports – especially NFL football.<br /><br />
    	The difference in coverage between the Rice and Hardy cases had more to do with their personalities than with their on-the-field ability. Thought Hardy played again after his incident and Rice did not, Hardy received a significant amount of negative media attention for comments he made in the aftermath about coming out “guns blazin’,” for fighting with teammates and for generally showing no remorse. Just this April, Hardy told ESPN’s Adam Schefter that Holder was lying and he was not guilty. On the other hand, Rice admitted to the attack from the very beginning and showed remorse for his actions. In his apology to Baltimore, he pledged to be a positive influence in people’s lives by raising awareness of the issue. Additionally, the fact that the bulk of the media attention on the Hardy case came after the Rice case influenced the way the media covered it. Overall, it would be difficult to assess whether the media was biased as a result of playing ability due to these other variables involved.<br /><br />
      Rice never received a chance to play for another team, but <a href="http://deadspin.com/ray-rices-biggest-problem-isnt-that-he-knocked-out-his-1696185532" target="blank">as Deadspin’s Greg Howard pointed out</a> in April 2015, that had more to do with his playing ability than his punching his fiancée in an elevator. After playing for the Cowboys last season, Hardy remains unsigned heading into May.<br /><br />
    	It’s difficult to discuss the effect the Rice and Hardy cases had on the media’s coverage of domestic violence in the NFL and the way the NFL handles offenders. In April, former Browns quarterback and Texas A&M star Johnny Manziel was indicted on charges of assaulting his ex-girlfriend. It is too early to tell how this case is being handled, but it will be worth keeping an eye on to see if the media, the NFL, or Goodell himself have learned any lessons from the past two years. Either way, it’s almost guaranteed Deadspin, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, and every other outlet will have a lot to say about it.<br /><br />
