      <span class="dropcap">O</span>n July 18, 1995, seven-year-old Jeffrey Moon dialed 911 to report that his parents were engaged in a violent altercation. His mother, Felicia Moon, told police when they arrived that her husband had slapped her, choked her, and engaged her in a high-speed car chase.  Three days later, during a joint press conference in the couple’s home, his father, Warren Moon, then the starting quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings and the NFL’s Man of the Year in 1989, admitted he had made a “terrible mistake”.  Later that day, Warren Moon was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault. Over the next several months, Felicia pleaded for him not to be prosecuted. Warren claimed that this was not a case of domestic violence but rather a "domestic dispute" that had gotten out of hand.<br /><br />
      In many ways, this played out like a typical case of domestic violence in America, where approximately 1.3 million women and 835,000 men are physically assaulted by an intimate partner each year, according to the Department of Justice.  What made this different, however, was Warren Moon’s hero status in Houston, where he played quarterback for the Oilers for ten seasons and was known for his charity work. As William Nack and Lester Munson wrote in Sports Illustrated the week following the arrest: <br /><br />
      <i>"There is no telling the outcome. Warren is a folk hero in Houston, a doer of good works – and this, after all, is a case of domestic violence. A neck-wringing minimized as a "domestic dispute." An assault masquerading as an argument. A crime perceived and treated like no other in America, especially, it seems, when it is committed by an athlete."</i><br /><br />
      On February 23, 1996, Warren Moon was acquitted. It took the jury less than half an hour to reach a decision.<br /><br />

      <h3>Domestic violence in the United States</h3>
      <span class="dropcap">I</span>t’s difficult to provide accurate statistics on domestic violence, as it is estimated that only one in ten incidents is reported.  Domestic violence is the single major cause of injury to women  and of all the women murdered in 2010, approximately 40 percent were killed by a spouse or someone they were dating, compared to 2 to 3 percent for men.  Domestic violence injuries are more common for women than injuries from auto accidents, muggings, and rapes combined.  Notoriously difficult to prosecute in court, many victims in domestic violence cases choose not to testify for various reasons, including fear of retribution from the abuser. Additionally, because attackers have an intimate relationship with their victims, they have an advantage other criminals don’t in that they are able to appeal for sympathy from the public, the criminal justice system, and the jury. This is especially true for professional athletes. In 1995, domestic violence cases involving professional athletes resulted in a 35 percent conviction rate, compared to 77 percent for the general population. <br /><br />

      <h3>A brief history of domestic violence in the NFL</h3>
      <span class="dropcap">T</span>he National Football League in particular has had a long history of domestic violence. In the 1990s, the high-profile cases of Moon and O.J. Simpson led then-Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to adopt the Personal Conduct Policy in 1997, the first of its kind in professional sports. The policy stated:<br /><br />
      <i>“the Commissioner will have the right . . . to fine . . . to suspend . . . and/or to terminate this contract” if the player is “guilty of any . . . form of conduct reasonably judged by the League Commissioner to be detrimental to the League or professional football.”</i><br /><br />
      Recently, two high-profile players have been suspended for domestic violence by current Commissioner Roger Goodell under an updated version of this policy – running back Ray Rice, formerly of the Baltimore Ravens, and defensive end Greg Hardy, who played with the Dallas Cowboys during the 2015 season. This website looks at the cases of these two players in order to analyze the way sports media cover domestic violence committed by professional football players. By looking at the ways in which the media covers domestic violence in the NFL, I hope to bring forward a discussion of how media influences the way Americans view domestic violence throughout our society.<br /><br />
      View the timelines to see how three outlets — ESPN, Sports Illustrated and Deadspin — covered the events in the Rice and Hardy cases. Below is my conclusion based on the research I did in tracking this coverage.<br /><br />
