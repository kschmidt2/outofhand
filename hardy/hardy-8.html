<a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/04/01/greg-hardy-domestic-violence-trial-photos-discipline" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12599181/in-greg-hardy-investigation-nfl-gets-access-photos-nicole-holder" target="blank">ESPN</a> both reported on April 1 that a North Carolina judge ruled to allow the NFL to view seven photographs from Hardy’s domestic violence trial showing Holder’s injuries. The league, players’ union, Hardy and his attorney were granted the right to view the photos, with the district attorney retaining custody of them.<br /><br />

Deadspin didn’t publish a story <a href="http://deadspin.com/da-nfl-union-can-see-pictures-from-greg-hardy-case-n-1696054959" target="blank">reporting the news<a/> till April 6, and focused on how NFL commissioner Roger Goodell needed help from law enforcement and got it. On the 1st, they published s tory asking why the NFL needs to see the photos in the first place. The reporter, Tom Ley, wrote:<br /><br />

“The NFL wants these photos not because it cares about getting Hardy’s punishment right, but because it wants to get the optics of the punishment right. The question the NFL is trying to answer isn’t ‘Did Greg Hardy beat his ex-girlfriend?’ but rather ‘How bad will we look if these pictures become public without us seeing them, and our punishment is deemed to have been too light?’”<br /><br />

Months later, on September 16, Deadspin <a href="http://deadspin.com/how-the-nfl-convinced-prosecutors-to-give-them-and-no-1729992346" target="blank">published an investigative story</a> looking at how the NFL convinced prosecuters to give them the photos. The reporter, Diana Moskovitz, points out, “as in the Rice case, the NFL knew the facts—a woman said a player beat her up, and nearly all the evidence backed her claim—but appeared reluctant to believe her without every possible visual confirmation.” Through public records requests, Deadspin found the NFL sued the district attorney office to obtain the photos, claiming they had a right to access the photos under public records laws. Using this social justice argument, the NFL was able to obtain the photos.<br /><br />
