<a href="http://deadspin.com/greg-hardys-girlfriend-testifies-in-hardys-assault-tria-1605431366" target="blank">Deadspin</a> focused its coverage of the trial on Holder’s testimony. Through tweets from reporters at the trial, Deadspin provided more details of what happened on the night of May 13, 2014, as told by Holder. Most notably, she said he threatened to kill her and she accepted at that point she was going to die.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/07/15/greg-hardy-panthers-not-guilty-plea-assault" target="blank">Sports Illustrated’s</a> coverage was brief. The magazine reported Hardy was found guilty, but in a 230-word post, made sure to include that Holder admitted to using cocaine the night of the assault. While SI didn’t outwardly blame Holder, it followed a pattern in coverage of violence against women of pointing out the woman’s dangerous activity as to imply the assault could have been prevented if she had acted differently.<br /><br />

<a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11220817/greg-hardy-carolina-panthers-guilty-2-counts-domestic-violence" target="blank">ESPN</a> didn’t publish the news till the following day, but their piece was straight-forward and reported the facts of the testimony and conviction before closing with Hardy’s statistics and contract situation.
