Hardy finally gave an interview regarding the domestic violence case and the photos that emerged in November. In the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/15132649/greg-hardy-denies-ever-put-hand-women" target="blank">interview with ESPN</a>, Hardy said:<br /><br />

"Pictures are pictures, and they can be made to look like whatever they want to. I didn't say I didn't do anything wrong. That situation occurred and that situation was handled, but as a man you can't avoid situations that aren't your fault or are your fault.”<br /><br />

He continued by saying, "Saying I did nothing wrong is a stretch, but saying I'm innocent is correct, sir."<br /><br />

<a href="http://deadspin.com/greg-hardy-says-hes-never-put-his-hands-on-a-woman-1768935434" target="blank">Deadspin</a> called Hardy's comments “incomprehensible,” while <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2016/04/05/greg-hardy-interview-espn-adam-schefter " target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> said the interview did nothing to help his reputation. The columnist, Melissa Jacobs, called the interview “cringe-worthy” and said even the look in Hardy’s eyes “did not convey a person who is remotely self-aware, or, more importantly, seeking redemption.” Jacobs also criticized the interviewer, Schefter, for not pressing Hardy on what happened that night and did not challenge Hardy’s notion that the photos were fake. Similarly, <a href="http://deadspin.com/of-course-adam-schefter-bought-into-greg-hardys-bullshi-1769223362 " target="blank">in a follow-up post</a>, Deadspin criticized Schefter after he went on ESPN radio and said:<br /><br />

“I went in with the idea that this guy is a monster. I came out of there with a very different feeling. I came out of there feeling this is a guy who has managed to say the wrong things at the wrong time.”<br /><br />

As Deadspin points out, this kind of media coverage is what makes it easy for people to get away with domestic abuse. “All you have to do is seem NICE, and be personable, and look somewhat even halfway chastened, and the Adam Schefters of the world will believe you, just because you shook their hand.”
