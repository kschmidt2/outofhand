ESPN’s Jean-Jacques Taylor <a href="http://deadspin.com/the-cowboys-are-in-over-their-heads-with-greg-hardy-1744177101" target="blank">broke news</a> of the meeting, in which Hardy ‘agreed to really work’ to improve his behavior. The meeting focused on what Hardy could personally do “to avoid creating negative issues for himself.” The article went on to summarize Hardy’s domestic violence case up to that point.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/11/22/greg-hardy-jerry-jones-cowboys-meeting-behavior" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> published a short post with this news, while <a href="http://deadspin.com/the-cowboys-are-in-over-their-heads-with-greg-hardy-1744177101" target="blank">Deadspin</a> added some analysis, saying:<br /><br />

“Whether Jones and the Cowboys really care about Hardy reforming as a human being is beside the point, because all they really need from him is for him to shut up and play football—to “hunker down,” as Jones put it.”<br /><br />
