Deadspin covered the fights with <a href="http://deadspin.com/greg-hardy-was-mad-at-everyone-today-1738600983" target="blank">Bryant</a> and <a href="http://deadspin.com/greg-hardy-got-in-a-fight-with-the-cowboys-special-team-1738623781" target="blank">Bisaccia</a> in separate posts and highlighted Jones’ comments after the game: “He’s, of course, one of the real leaders on this team and he earns it and he earns it with respect from all of his teammates and that’s the kind of thing that inspires a football team.” The following day, Deadspin <a href="http://deadspin.com/the-cowboys-are-just-going-to-keep-covering-for-greg-ha-1738644575" target="blank">published a story</a> titled “The Cowboys Are Just Going To Keep Covering For Greg Hardy.”<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/25/cowboys-greg-hardy-dez-bryant-fight-video" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/13973515/greg-hardy-dez-bryant-dallas-cowboys-appear-get-testy-exchange-sidelines" target="blank">ESPN</a> covered the altercations in a similar fashion, with ESPN including more quotes from coaches and players dismissing, or even encouraging, the behavior. The following day, Sports Illustrated’s MMQB <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/mmqb/2015/10/27/nfl-dallas-cowboys-greg-hardy-jerry-jones-jason-garrett" target="blank">posted a column</a> arguing the Cowboys’ Hardy experiment had gone awry.<br /><br />

The day after the game, ESPN’s Skip Bayless defended Hardy, saying “I don’t have a major problem with <i>what</i> Greg Hardy did, I only have a major problem with when he chose to do it.” Deadspin <a href="http://deadspin.com/why-would-anyone-defend-greg-hardy-1738682051" target="blank">published a post</a> in response asking, “why would anyone defend Greg Hardy?” The post’s author, Greg Howard, pointed out there’s no scenario where it’s okay to fight your coworkers.
