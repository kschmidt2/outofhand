This event flew under the radar at the time, with just ESPN <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12415473/greg-hardy-carolina-panthers-meet-nfl-officials" target="blank">publishing a piece</a> the day before saying Hardy was set to meet with NFL officials. The big blow came on November 11 of that year, when Deadspin <a href="http://deadspin.com/inside-the-nfl-hearing-that-reinstated-greg-hardy-1741750722" target="blank">published the transcript</a> of the closed-door meeting that reinstated Hardy. In summarizing the transcript, Deadspin highlighted the fact that Hardy said Holder must have tripped and used the sex lives of Holder and Kristina Laurence, the principal witness for the state, to attack them and their credibility. Hardy used common “slut-shaming” tactics to discredit the victim and it ultimately led to his reinstatement into the NFL.
