On November 6, Deadspin dropped a bombshell when it published <a href="http://deadspin.com/the-greg-hardy-documents-1740903440" target="blank">court documents</a> and <a href="http://deadspin.com/this-is-why-nfl-star-greg-hardy-was-arrested-for-assaul-1739117634" target="blank">photos</a> from Hardy’s trial. The documents provided a clearer narrative of what occurred on the night of May 13, 2014, and the accompanying photos appear to implicate Hardy in a brutal assault. As Deadspin wrote:<br /><br />

“Unlike Ray Rice, the former Baltimore Ravens star who was filmed knocking his future wife unconscious in an elevator, Hardy hasn’t become a pariah. That’s partly because he’s more valuable on the field, but also because of the perception that nobody knows what really happened that night.”<br /><br />

The photos Deadspin released showed bruises all over Holder’s body, including her back, arms, legs, chin, neck and foot. Deadspin said they chose to publish them based on the convincing evidence they present of what happened that night.<br /><br />

Later that day, Jones <a href="http://deadspin.com/cowboys-owner-jerry-jones-releases-statement-supporting-1741123627" target="blank">released a statement</a> supporting Hardy:<br /><br />

“While we did not have access to the photos that became public today, we were and are aware of the serious nature of this incident. We as an organization take this very seriously. We do not condone domestic violence. We entered into the agreement with Greg fully understanding that there would be scrutiny and criticism. We have given Greg a second chance. He is a member of our team and someone who is grateful for the opportunity he has been given to move forward with his life and his career.”<br /><br />

Sports Illustrated <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/11/06/greg-hardy-photos-domestic-violence-assault-dallas-cowboys" target="blank">ran a story</a> focusing on how Hardy refused to comment on the photos and reported on Jones’ comments. The next day, <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/11/06/greg-hardy-photos-nicole-holder-cowboys-nfl" target="blank">Michael Rosenberg</a> wrote for SI that it shouldn’t have taken photo evidence to stir up outrage over Hardy’s actions. In his column, Rosenberg asked:<br /><br />

“Why do we need video or photo evidence to believe victims of domestic violence? What the heck is wrong with us? If your daughter told you the story that Nicole Holder told police last year, would you demand to see photographs?”<br /><br />

He goes on to point out that Hardy got another chance to play, while Rice didn’t, because he was a better player.<br /><br />

ESPN delivered a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14067650/greg-hardy-photos-alleged-domestic-violence-incident-revealed" target="blank">straight news story</a> and made it a point to note the Cowboys had not seen the photos when they signed Hardy. They <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4746833/source-first-time-cowboys-saw-photos-was-friday" target="blank">also reported</a> the first time the team saw the photos was the Friday before they were released by Deadspin.
