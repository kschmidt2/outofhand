Upon winning his appeal, Rice became elligible to play immediately. <a href="http://deadspin.com/ray-rice-wins-appeal-eligible-to-play-immediately-1664372852" target="blank">Deadspin</a>, <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/11/28/ap-fbn-ray-rice-appeal" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11949855/ray-rice-baltimore-ravens-wins-appeal-eligible-reinstatement" target="blank">ESPN</a> all reported that former U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones found that Rice did not lie and the NFL never asked Rice for the second video, though he had access to it as part of his court case.<br /><br />

Peter King addressed the Rice verdict in <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2014/12/01/patriots-packers-super-bowl-nfl-week-13" target="blank">his weekely MMQB column for SI</a> with five points. In contrast from the magazine's stance on the issue, King asked how Goodell could have thought it was fair to indefinitely suspend a first-time offender after initally issuing a two-game suspension. He then addressed Rice's future in the league, in which two NFL general managers told him they believeed the running back would be in training camp in 2015. He pointed out that the judge did not find any wrongdoing on the NFL's part, but that she said in her report that Goodell called a meeting after the second video was released to make sure everyone's stories were straight and pointed out the judge believed Rice's version of the truth more than the league's.
