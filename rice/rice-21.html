The NFL announced it would be launching an independent investigation into the Rice situation, headed by former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III. <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11505460/former-fbi-director-probe-rice-case" target="blank">ESPN</a> and <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/10/fbi-roger-goodell-ray-rice-nfl-investigation" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> both delivered straight news stories. Sports Illustrated also published <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/24/roger-goodell-ray-rice-investigation-robert-mueller-wilmerhale" target="blank">a story about the ties between the NFL and Mueller's firm</a>. The author wrote, "<i>independent</i> is hardly the way to describe the probe" and pointed out that the president of the Ravens was a partner in Mueller's firm for 31 years. Further, many former lawyers at the firm went on to jobs in-house with the NFL and its teams.
