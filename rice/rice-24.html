ESPN's Outside the Lines dropped <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11551518/how-ray-rice-scandal-unfolded-baltimore-ravens-roger-goodell-nfl" target="blank">a bombshell of a story</a> with its investigation of the Rice situation. First, the investigation found the Ravens actively worked to keep the elevator video from becoming public, with Rice believing he was offered a front office job if he went along with the story that he misled the team. The report said the Ravens head of security received a detailed description of the video hours after the incident and relayed it to Ravens leadership. ESPN also claimed that head coach John Harbaugh asked the Ravens to release Rice as soon as he heard about the incident.<br /><br />

<a href="http://deadspin.com/espn-rice-believes-ravens-owner-tried-to-bribe-him-in-1637019552" target="blank">Deadspin</a> and <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/19/baltimore-ravens-ozzie-newsome-steve-bisciotti-dick-cass-john-harbaugh-roger-goodell-ray-rice" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> published summaries of the report, with Deadspin poiting out that the OTL piece did not mention the AP's report that the NFL had seen the tape, and Sports Illustrated saying if the report was true, the Ravens' credibility was shot.<br /><br />

 A few days later, <a href="http://deadspin.com/espn-made-a-very-weird-mistake-in-its-big-ray-rice-stor-1638541045" target="blank">Deadspin pointed out</a> that ESPN made a strange error in its story by making it seem as though they were quoting Rice's and the Ravens' text messages directly when actually they were paraphrased by reporters. Deadspin then <a href="http://deadspin.com/heres-every-edit-espn-has-made-to-its-otl-ray-rice-rave-1638729696" target="blank">posted every edit</a> ESPN made to its story without making it clear to readers that they made corrections of fact.
