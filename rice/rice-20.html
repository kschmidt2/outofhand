Ravens leadership sat down for an interview with the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> and general manager Ozzie Newsome said Rice described for them earlier in the year exactly what they saw on the video. <a href="http://deadspin.com/ravens-gm-what-we-saw-on-the-video-was-what-ray-said-1633190051" target="blank">Deadspin</a> pointed out that this contradicted the NFL's claim that what Rice told them during their meeting was "ambiguous" and "not consistent" with what the video showed. This meant that if Newsome was telling the truth, the NFL was either lying or at the very least did not ask the Ravens about what Rice told them. <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/10/baltimore-ravens-ray-rice-ozzie-newsome" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> also reported the news, but did not include the conflict with what the NFL was manintaining at the time.<br /><br />

Two days later, after the the NFL said it increased the suspension because of a "stark difference" between what Rice told them and what was on the elevator video, ESPN's Outside the Lines <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11509397/ray-rice-told-nfl-roger-goodell-june-had-hit-wife" target="blank">reported that Rice also told the NFL what happened</a>. Several sources said there was no ambiguity about what happened in the elevator, with one source quoted as saying, "he told the truth. This is a public lynching of Ray."
