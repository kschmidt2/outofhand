<a href="http://deadspin.com/ray-rice-indicted-on-a-more-serious-charge-than-expecte-1553143323" target="blank">Deadspin</a>,  <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10684250/ray-rice-baltimore-ravens-indicted-aggravated-assault" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/audibles/2014/03/27/ray-rice-indicted-assault-charges" target="blank">ESPN</a> all reported that Rice was facing a charge of aggravated assault and up to five years in prison. Only Deadspin inferred that the video from inside the elevator probably existed since neither Ray nor Janay wanted the case to be tried. Both SI and ESPN chose to use quotes from Rice's attorney, Michael Diamondstein, affirming Ray's innocence and pointing out that Ray and Janay are happy together, while Deadspin used a quote saying that Ray was not putting blame on Janay and asking the public to reserve judgment until the facts come out.
