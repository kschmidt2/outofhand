The day Ray Rice won his appeal, ESPN published <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11913473/janay-rice-gives-own-account-night-atlantic-city" tagret="blank">Janay's account of the night in Atlantic City and the aftermath</a>. Janay admitted her apology followed the Ravens' suggested script. She also disclosed she didn't remember much of what happened in the elevator and accepted responsibility for hitting Ray.<br /><br />

Sports Illustrated <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/11/28/janay-rice-explains-hotel-elevator-incident" target="blank">published a summary</a> of her account. Deadspin <a href="http://deadspin.com/what-happened-when-janay-rice-met-with-the-nfl-in-june-1664407982" target="blank">focused on</a> what happened when Ray and Janay met with the NFL in June. Janay told the league it was a one-time event and she just wanted the saga to be over. This apparently played a large role in the NFL's decision to suspend Rice only two games.
