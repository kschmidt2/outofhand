<a href="http://deadspin.com/report-greg-hardys-teammate-called-him-a-woman-beater-1700041656" target="blank">Deadspin’s</a> coverage of this incident stands out in that it was the only outlet to use ‘woman beater’ in the headline. <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/04/24/dallas-cowboys-greg-hardy-verbal-altercation-davon-coleman" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/12756996/dallas-cowboys-de-greg-hardy-altercation-teammate-davon-coleman" target="blank">ESPN</a> both mentioned it in their stories, but used ‘verbal altercation’ or ‘verbal spat’ in their headlines. ESPN points out “altercations like this are not unusual, but Hardy’s past and this week’s suspension add to the story.” While ESPN devotes a paragraph to summarizing the domestic violence case, they seem to be downplaying the case and the reason for the argument.
