Coverage of Ray and Janay's press conference varied in each publication. <a href="http://deadspin.com/ray-rice-sometimes-in-life-you-will-get-knocked-down-1580795933" target="blank">Deadspin</a> focused on Ray's words, using his quote "sometimes in life, you will get knocked down" in its headline. The story highlighted all of Ray's problematic quotes and called the press conference "one of the most insanely un-self-aware" in history. The story also highlighted two weets from the Ravens, one said "Ray Rice: 'Failure is not getting knocked down. It's not getting up'" and the other said "Janay Rice says she deeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incident."<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/audibles/2014/05/23/ray-rice-apology-aggravated-assault-wife-janay-palmer" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> was not as blunt in its coverage as Deadspin, but did highlight the backlash the Rices' comments, and the Ravens' tweets, received on social media. "If she wants to stand by her man, that's her choice. It is dangerous and irresponsible of the [organization] to give voice to victim blaming," said one response highlighted in the story. Additionally, the author wrote, "Given the nature of the charge against him, it was unfortunate choice of words at best and utterly tone deaf at worst."<br /><br />

<a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10975363/ray-rice-baltimore-ravens-apologizes-says-failed-miserably" target="blank">ESPN</a>, on the other hand, did not report any issue with Rice's comments and did not even print his quotes about getting knocked down, nor did the story mention the Ravens' tweets. ESPN chose quotes from Ray that caste him in a better light and concluded its story with Janay's quote about her role in the incident.<br /><br />

Months later, on December 1, Janay admitted on the Today Show that the Ravens told her to apologize at the press conference. Deadspin <a href="http://deadspin.com/janay-rice-says-ravens-told-her-to-apologize-at-that-pr-1665112586" target="blank">published a piece</a> on the matter, adding that Janay said she would not have participated in the press conference if the Ravens hadn't urged her to and she completely understoof the backlash she received for her apology.
