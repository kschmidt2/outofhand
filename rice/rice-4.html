ESPN's Jamison Hensley <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/afcnorth/post/_/id/78011/harbaugh-follows-history-by-supporting-rice" target="blank">wrote a column</a> discussing Ravens coach John Harbaugh's comments at the NFL combine, in which he said, at the time, he couldn't see a scenario where Rice would not be a part of the Ravens in 2014. Hensley noted this comment would not sit well with people who wanted Rice released after the video and police summons were published, but did not comment on Harbaugh's comments himself.<br /><br />

Meanwhile, Sports Illustrated reported <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/02/20/ray-rice-baltimore-ravens-assault-police" target="blank">police had video</a> of Ray knocking Janay unconscious. SI refrained from using this language in its headline, only saying police had video of an alleged assault, while Deadspins's <a href="http://deadspin.com/report-police-have-video-of-ray-rice-knocking-fiancee-1527756119" target="blank">write up</a> of SI's report did include in its headline that the video depicted Ray knocking his fianc√©e unconscious.
