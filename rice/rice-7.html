Deadspin published several posts after Hardy signed with the Cowboys. <a href="http://deadspin.com/the-cowboys-will-basically-pay-greg-hardy-per-game-1692223388" target="blank">The first</a> discussed the terms of his deal, which was mostly made up of incentives based on games played. The site also <a href="http://deadspin.com/dallas-sportscaster-blasts-the-cowboys-for-signing-greg-1692314454" target="blank">shared a video clip</a> of a Dallas Sportscaster ripping into the Cowboys for signing Hardy, as well as <a href="http://deadspin.com/dallas-mayor-calls-greg-hardy-signing-a-shot-in-the-gu-1692602787" target="blank">a clip</a> of Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings calling the signing “a shot in the gut.”<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/03/18/dallas-cowboys-sign-greg-hardy-deal" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> focused on the signing from a football perspective, giving the signing a grade of B-plus. The reason the grade wasn’t higher? The potential for a PR fallout. SI also included a statement from Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones in which he said, “our organization understands the very serious nature of domestic violence in our society and in our league.”<br /><br />

<a href="http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/12508402/dallas-cowboys-greg-hardy-agree-one-year-deal" target="blank">ESPN</a> covered the news in a similar manner to Sports Illustrated and included a brief summary of the domestic violence case.
