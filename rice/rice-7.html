 <a href="http://deadspin.com/ray-rice-got-married-brandon-spikes-wants-someone-to-c-1554429779" target="blank">Deadspin</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10693847/ray-rice-baltimore-ravens-gets-married-janay-palmer-one-day-indictment" target="blank">ESPN</a> published similar stories reporting on Ray and Janay's marriage, as well as comments made on Twitter by then-Bills linebacker Brandon Spikes saying someone should choke Rice out. ESPN added analysis from its legal expert saying the marriage could make it difficult to prove the case against Ray as Janay could claim spousal privilege in order not to testify.
