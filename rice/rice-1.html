<a href="http://deadspin.com/greg-hardy-accused-of-beating-girlfriend-throwing-her-1576313205" target="blank">Deadspin</a> and <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/audibles/2014/05/14/details-emerge-greg-hardy-arrest-carolina-panthers" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> both reported the news of Hardy’s arrest the night before, first reported by the Charlotte Observer. According to the testimony of his then-girlfriend, Nicole Holder, Hardy picked her up and threw her into the tiled area of a bathroom, then dragged her into the bedroom, choked her, picked her up, and threw her onto a couch covered in guns. Holder was seen outside Hardy’s hearing the next day with her arm in a sling.<br /><br />

Meanwhile, David Newton of ESPN <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/carolina-panthers/post/_/id/6498/hardy-damaged-potential-for-long-term-future-with-panthers" target="blank">wrote a story</a> with the headline, “Hardy jeopardizes future with Panthers.” While Newton states “there is nothing funny about what Hardy has been accused of,” he focuses his story on the effect the arrest will have on the player’s career. Focusing on the effect the accusation will have on the abuser is a common theme in media coverage of domestic violence and is on display in this ESPN piece.
