Hours after the elevator was released,the Ravens announced they were releasing Rice. Twenty minutes later, the NFL announced they were suspending him indefinitely. Deadspin's <a href="http://deadspin.com/ravens-release-ray-rice-1632042601" target="blank">post on the moves</a> was short and to the point, while ESPN published <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11489134/baltimore-ravens-cut-ray-rice-new-video-surfaces" target="blank">a more in-depth story</a> that covered reactions from people such as former Raven Ray Lewis and a statement from President Barack Obama's press secretary. The story also listed stores that were pulling Rice jerseys from their shelves and places offering incentives for fans to turn in their Rice jerseys. <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/08/ray-rice-released-by-baltimore-ravens-suspended-by-nfl" target="blank">Sports Illustrated's story</a> carried a headline including "Ravens execute damage control" and summarized the case up to that point.<br /><br />

Additional coverage included <a href="http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/11490055/the-real-reason-why-ray-rice-suspended-indefinitely" target="blank">a column published on ESPNW (ESPN's women's site)</a> in which the authoer, Jane McManus, argued the NFL should have suspended Rice indefinitely long before the elevator video was released to the public. "He should have been suspended because the blow itself was a violation fo the personal conduct policy," she wrote. She goes on to point out that so much of domestic violence happens behind closed doors and most victims will never have video evidence on their side.<br /><br />

Meanwhile, Deadspin published <a href="http://deadspin.com/mike-ditka-laments-ray-rice-suspension-his-earning-po-1632172878" target="blank">a post criticizing ESPN commentator Mike Ditka</a>, who said on air, "these two lives are ruined. His earning power is destroyed. That's an important thing." Deadspin continued its criticism of ESPN by <a href="http://deadspin.com/dilfer-berman-praise-nfl-in-ridiculous-recap-of-ray-r-1632295029" target="blank">posting a clip</a> of Chris Berman and Trent Dilfer praising the NFL and the Ravens for their swift response during Monday Night Football.<br /><br />

Sport's Illustrated's Monday Morning Quarterback <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2014/09/08/ray-rice-video-cut-by-ravens-suspended-by-nfl" target="blank">published a column</a> saying that it took too long for the NFL and the Ravens to deal with Rice, as they waited until they had no other choice. SI also <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/08/ray-rice-video-legal-fallout-roger-goodell-baltimore-ravens" target="blank">ran a story</a> covering the legal ramifications of the video and the fallout and <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/08/ray-rice-cut-baltimore-ravens-future-roger-goodell" target="blank">one arguing</a> that once the video was released, there was no way for Rice to return to the Ravens.
