<a href="http://deadspin.com/domestic-abuse-charges-against-greg-hardy-dismissed-1684666032" target="blank">Deadspin</a>, <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/02/09/carolina-panthers-greg-hardy-domestic-abuse-charges-dropped" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12300188/charges-vs-greg-hardy-carolina-panthers-tossed" target="blank">ESPN</a> all took a straight-forward approach to reporting this story. Deadspin was the only one of the three to report that Hardy and Holder reached a civil settlement, the details of which are unknown. ESPN continued its trend of reporting how the news affects the Panthers and the NFL at the end of its story and mentions that Hardy would have been subject to a minimum six-game suspension if he had been found guilty.
