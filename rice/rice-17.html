The day after they released the video to the public, TMZ reported that the NFL had seen the elevator video prior to its public release. Deadspin <a href="http://deadspin.com/tmzer-nfl-employees-saw-the-ray-rice-video-before-mond-1632311210" target="blank">posted a story</a> on this report. The NFL responded with a statement saying the league had asked the New Jersey State Police for the video but had not received it. <a href="http://deadspin.com/nfl-statement-says-league-never-asked-casino-for-ray-ri-1632356613" target="blank">Deadspin</a>, <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/09/roger-goodell-nfl-ray-rice-comments" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11494073/nfl-says-ray-rice-video-was-sought-multiple-sources" target="blank">ESPN</a> all reported on and published the statement.<br /><br />

<a href="http://deadspin.com/roger-goodell-no-one-in-the-nfl-viewed-ray-rice-tape-1632715561" target="blank">Deadspin</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11495969/roger-goodell-says-nfl-had-not-seen-ray-rice-video" target="blank">ESPN</a> also reported on Goodell's comments later that evening on CBS Evening News in which he reiterated that no one in the league had seen the tape. Deadspin pointed out that Goodell never really answered the question of if he really needed to see the video from inside the elevator in order to act forcefully in punishing Rice. The following day, <a href="http://deadspin.com/roger-goodell-tells-owners-nfl-did-not-ask-casino-for-r-1633083058" target="blank">Goodell sent a memo to owners</a> saying the NFL did not ask the Revel casino for the footage from inside the elevator.<br /><br />

A few hours after the report that the NFL had seen the video, Deadspin <a href="http://deadspin.com/espners-are-pissed-at-the-nfl-over-its-ray-rice-video-c-1632424069" target="blank">wrote a story</a> about two ESPN reporters who reported on the contents of the elevator video earlier in the year, with their information coming from league sources.
