After Hardy’s first game after the photos were released, two Eagles players, center Jason Kelce and tackle Lane Johnson, admit they made it a point to go after Hardy. <a href="http://deadspin.com/two-eagles-made-a-point-of-going-after-greg-hardy-1741408526" target="blank">Deadspin,</a> <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/11/09/philadelphia-eagles-dallas-cowboys-lane-johnson-greg-hardy-extra-mustard" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14088447/philadelphia-eagles-linemen-rip-greg-hardy-dallas-cowboys-seemed-it" target="blank">ESPN</a> each posted similar stories covering what the players said after the game.<br /><br />

Hardy was also not available for comment after the game as he hid while reporters were in the locker room, then got picked up in his white Ferrari, <a href="http://deadspin.com/greg-hardy-went-out-of-his-way-to-avoid-the-media-1741431425" target="blank">Deadspin reported<a/>.<br /><br />

Sports Illustrated also <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/11/09/greg-hardy-cris-collinsworth-nbc-cowboys-eagles" target="blank">posted a story discussing how NBC’s Sunday Night Football commentators Cris Collinsworth and Al Michaels handled calling the game. Collinsworth told SI:<br /><br />

“I didn’t want to go in and start saying, 'Oh, boy, look at Greg Hardy ripping off the edge and getting pressure on the quarterback' without having said at some point that I’m a husband, I’m a father, and I’m completely uncomfortable talking about this guy right now. We have a job to do and we have to call this football game but I did not want people thinking we did not get it. If you are feeling uncomfortable, we were feeling uncomfortable. Or at least I was. I wanted everyone to know we didn’t live under a rock.”<br /><br />
