The Rice situation appeared to be settled, then, on Sept. 8, TMZ published the video from inside the elevator, igniting the issue again. Both <a href="http://deadspin.com/heres-video-of-ray-rice-knocking-out-his-fiancee-in-an-1631864196" target="blank">Deadspin</a> and <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/08/baltimore-ravens-ray-rice-new-video-striking-wife" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> published the video along with their summaries, while <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11486837/new-video-released-baltimore-ravens-ray-rice-hitting-fiancee" target="blank">ESPN</a> did not include the video. All three stories discussed how there were reports circulating that Googell had seen the video, while the NFL claimed it did not have access to the footage before it was released to the public.<br /><br />

Deadspin went a step further, publishing <a href="http://deadspin.com/someone-is-lying-about-whether-the-nfl-saw-the-ray-rice-1631901404" target="blank">a separate story</a> saying someone was lying about whether the NFL saw the tape. It had been reported in July by reporters from both Sports Illustrated and ESPN that it had, but the NFL was denying it. The article said there were three possible scenarios: all of the reporters were lying (unlikely), the NFL lied to reporters back in July, perhaps to try to smear Janay, or the NFL was currently lying.<br /><br />

ESPN's Adam Schefter went on air to criticize the NFL for its statement that the league did not see the tape. Deadspin <a href="http://deadspin.com/adam-schefter-is-fed-up-with-the-nfl-1631937239" target="blank">covered his segments</a>, emphasizing that reporters were angry because the NFL made them look like liars for reporting the league had seen the tape. Deadspin also <a href="http://deadspin.com/has-peter-king-read-his-own-reporting-on-the-ray-rice-f-1631901579" target="blank">reported on</a> SI's Peter King backtracking on his earlier reporting about the NFL having had seen the tape.
