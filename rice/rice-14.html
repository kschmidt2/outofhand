Deadspin covered Hardy’s return by <a href="http://deadspin.com/listen-to-jim-nantz-and-phil-simms-debate-greg-hardy-1735953323" target="blank">posting a video clip</a> of CBS’s Phil Simms and Jim Nantz having a conversation during the game about whether Greg Hardy would still be on the field if he wasn;t such a good player. Sports Illustrated <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/11/dallas-cowboys-terry-bradshaw-greg-hardy-comments" target="blank">took a similar approach</a> by posting a clip of FOX’s Terry Bradshaw saying “anybody, in my opinion, who lays a hand on a woman…you never come back in this league.”<br /><br />

The following day, ESPN <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4746067/greg-hardy-makes-impact-on-field-but-thats-not-full-story" target="blank">published a story</a> about Hardy’s first game back, referring to the domestic violence case as an “incident.” “Even though the charges were dismissed,” the story says, “he was initially suspended 10 games for violating the personal-conduct policy after he was accused of assaulting and threatening to kill an ex-girlfriend.” The story does not mention that Hardy was initially convicted and the charges were eventually dismissed because Holder failed to testify. The story then shifts focus to Hardy’s role on the team and the reasons Jones signed him. This is another example of ESPN downplaying the domestic violence case and could be considered an example of a redemption story for the perpetrator, which is common in media portrayals of gendered violence.
