Deadspin’s coverage of Hardy’s first post-suspension news conference was limited to <a href="http://deadspin.com/katie-nolan-calls-out-garbage-human-greg-hardy-1735395249" target="blank">posting a video clip</a> of Fox Sport’s Katie Nolan calling Hardy a “garbage human” in light of him showing no remorse and even making sexist comments about Tom Brady’s wife.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/06/cowboys-greg-hardy-return-suspension-guns-quote" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/13824913/greg-hardy-dallas-cowboys-says-look-back-preps-return-suspension" target="blank">ESPN</a> both had more traditional coverage, with SI opting to use the “guns blazing” comment in the headline, and ESPN simply saying that Hardy avoided talking about the incident in its headline. In fact, ESPN did not mention the “guns blazing” quote until the very end of its story. Both outlets also published Jones' response to Hardy's comments:<br /><br />

“Well, you’re not allowed to have guns on the football field. We all know that’s just a way of expressing yourself. I hope his guns are ablazin’.
