This is where the Rice case, and the media's coverage of it, starts to get crazy.<br /><br />

Deadspinâ€™s  <a href="http://deadspin.com/reports-ray-rice-suspended-for-two-games-for-uppercutt-1610151745" target="blank">initial report of the suspension</a> highlights everything that had happened so far and emphasized that Rice punched his then-fiancee and that it was reported it was "far from a minor incident." The story closed by mentioning that Josh Gordon, another NFL player, was at the time facing a 16-game suspension for smoking weed.<br /><br />

Following up on the tone from its initial story, Deadspin went on to publosh several posts critizing the NFL for the lenient suspension and the media for its reaction. First was a <a href="http://deadspin.com/nfl-network-on-ray-rice-suspension-the-iron-fist-of-t-1610183608" target="blank"> post criticizing the NFL Network</a> for saying Rice's suspension was hi "dealing with the iron fist of the NFL." They followed up with a <a href="http://deadspin.com/ladies-buy-your-pink-ray-rice-jerseys-today-1610165687" target="blank">tongue-in-cheeck post</a> reminding ladies they could buy their pink Ray Rice jerseys at the NFL online store. They also <a href="http://deadspin.com/nfl-statement-on-ray-rice-wants-you-to-believe-it-came-1610287748" target="blank">criticized the NFL's statement</a>, calling it "ballsy" and saying the NFL made it sound like they came down hard on Rice. There was also <a href="http://deadspin.com/john-harbaugh-sees-ray-rices-suspension-as-a-good-lesso-1610299844" target="blank">a post</a> criticizing Ravens coach John Harbaugh's comments that the suspension was a good lesson for kids. Moving onto the media, Deadpsin <a href="http://deadspin.com/espn-spent-the-past-24-hours-carrying-water-for-the-nfl-1610928027" target="blank">accused ESPN of "carrying water for the NFL"</a> and pointed out that other outlets, such as CBS, NBC, and Fox, which all also broadcast NFL games, were critical of the decision. A week later, Greg Howard at Deadspin asked <a href="http://deadspin.com/does-the-nfl-think-ray-rices-wife-deserved-it-1612138248" target="blank"> if the NFL thought Janay deserved it</a>.<br /><br />

Sports Illustrated began its coverage with a <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/07/24/baltimore-ravens-ray-rice-suspended-first-two-games-season-domestic-assault" target="blank">short, straight-forward post on the suspension</a>. Chris Burke followed up with <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/07/24/ray-rice-suspension-roger-goodell-baltimore-ravens" target="blank">a column</a> blasting the NFL for the suspension, saying the league views smoking marijuana or taking Adderall as more serious crimes than allegedly knkcking your fiancee out cold. Burke pointed out that commissioner Goodell had a chance to put his foot down, but instead did the opposite. He calls on Goodell to step away from black-and-white league rules and "approach his job with some semblance of a human element." The next day, SI's Monday Morning Quarterback blog <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2014/07/25/ray-rice-nfl-suspension-ravens" target="blank">posted a column</a> in which they said Rice "caught a major break ... except in the court of public opinion." This story also compared the suspension to the league's drug suspensions before discussing what could be expected of Rice in the upcoming football season.<br /><br />

ESPN's reporting on the suspension was more straight-forward. <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11257692/ray-rice-baltimore-ravens-suspended-2-games" target="blank">The first story</a> was a straight news piece featuring quotes from both Rice and Goodell regarding the suspension. The article concluded with a summary of the monetary implications for Rice as well as the implications for the Ravens' offense. A few days later, they <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11275300/nfl-vp-adolpho-birch-disagrees-league-two-game-suspension-ray-rice-baltimore-ravens-was-too-light" target="blank">reported on</a> the NFL's senior vice president for labor policy saying he didn't think the suspension was too light. Some of ESPN's on-air talent, such as Michelle Beadle and Keith Olbermann, criticized the NFL, but ESPN's online reporting did not offer commentary.
