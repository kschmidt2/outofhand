ESPN <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11093940/ray-rice-baltimore-ravens-wife-met-roger-goodell" target="blank">published a short news story</a> reporting that Goodell had met with Ray and Janay Rice, calling the meeting an important step as the NFL decided on discipline.<br /><br />

Deadspin <a href="http://deadspin.com/why-roger-goodells-meeting-with-ray-rice-and-his-wife-w-1611087864" target="blank">published a piece</a> about the meeting after a suspension was issued in July. On July 28, Diana Moskovitz wrote why Goodell meeting with both Rices together was a bad idea. She quoted Rene Renick, vice president at the National Network to End Domestic Violence, as saying, "Even having the two of them in the room and thinking that she can speak freely in that kind of a situation is crazy." She also called the meeting "outrageous." Moskovitz pointed out that while this is standad procedure for any player caught behaving badly in the NFL, but in the context of domestic violence, this is a bad thing for the league to encourage. Renick did also mention the one positive she found in the situation - that so many people were criticizing the league for their lax punishment of Rice.
