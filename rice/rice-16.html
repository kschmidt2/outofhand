<a href="http://deadspin.com/janay-rice-releases-statement-this-is-our-life-1632366280" target="blank">Deadspin</a> and <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/09/ray-rice-wife-breaks-silence" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> both published Janay Rice's statement made through Instagram in which she slammed the media for causing pain to her family and calling the situation a "horrible nightmare." ESPN also <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11493042/janay-rice-defends-ray-rice-criticizes-media-instagram-post" target="blank">shared the post</a>, but also had a reporter who spoke to Ray and Janay about the statement. They both expressed support for one another and Janay asked people to respect their privacy. ESPN then provided a recap of the case up until that point.
