The Ray Rice saga wrapped up on February 13, 2015, with the former Ravens running back apologizing to Baltimore and thanking the fans. <a href="http://deadspin.com/ray-rice-apologizes-to-baltimore-1685630708" target="blank">Deadspin</a> and <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/02/13/ray-rice-apology-baltimore-ravens" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> both republished Rice's letter to fans that ran in the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> in which Rice wrote:<br /><br />

 "There is no excuse for domestic violence, and I apologize for the horrible mistake I made. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, and I hope to make a positive difference in people's lives by raising awareness of this issue."

Rice did not get a chance with another team in 2015; the domestic violence incident ended his career.
