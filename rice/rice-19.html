Two days after the elevator video was released and a day after the NFL and Goodell denied they had not seen it, the Associated Press reported the league received the video in April. <a href="http://deadspin.com/report-nfl-had-copy-of-ray-rice-tape-1633159819" target="blank">Deadspin</a> covered the news with an update from the NFL statement doubling down on its stance that no one in the league had seen the tape. <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/10/ray-rice-video-nfl-roger-goodell" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11503851/ray-rice-videotape-sent-nfl-executive-april" target="blank">ESPN</a> published similar straight-forward news stories.<br /><br />

Deadspin followed up with <a href="http://deadspin.com/goodell-was-wrong-when-he-said-casino-couldnt-have-give-1633218945" target="blank">a report</a> saying the Revel casino could have given the NFL the tape, despite Goodell's statement the day before saying it would be illegal for the casino to share the tape during an ongoing investigation. The article closed byasking if the NFL received bad legal advice or if it was just a bad excuse.<br /><br />

SI's MMQB <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2014/09/10/roger-goodell-credibility-ray-rice-bountygate" target="blank">followed up with a column</a> saying that though Goodell's job was safe becasue the owners would not vote him out, his credibility was shot.
