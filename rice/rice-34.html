The NFL-backed investigation into the Ray Rice situation revealed the NFL never saw the tape before its release to the public on Sept. 8, but did say the league could have done more to properly investigate the charges. ESPN <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12138032/nfl-did-not-previously-see-ray-rice-elevator-video-according-mueller-report" target="blank">reported on the story</a> without mentioning the ties between Mueller and the NFL, implying that the report was impartial.<br /><br />

Sports Illustrated <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/01/08/ray-rice-case-mueller-report-nfl" target="blank">took a similar approach</a>, but included that the report called the investigation "limited," which the ESPN story did not mention. Though SI had earlier reported on the ties between Mueller's firm and the NFL, this article did not mention the relationship. Michael Rosenberg <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/01/08/nfl-roger-goodell-ray-rice-robert-mueller-report" target="blank">wrote a follow-up column</a> warning readers not to be fooled by headlines: Goodell lied. He said on Sept. 8 the NFL contacted law enforcement to request any and all information from the incident, but the report found the league never contacted any police officers who investigated the incident. He also pointed out that Mueller made no attempt to find out if Goodell lied to the public about what Rice told him. He claimed Goodell did not ask Mueller to lie, but rather to find "a different truth."<br /><br />

Deadspin also <a href="http://deadspin.com/nfl-backed-investigation-nfl-didnt-lie-about-seeing-ra-1678291973" target="blank">summarized the report</a>, pointing out that Mueller didn't discuss the actual investigation much, and instead focused on the punishment, the video and what the AP reported. An hour later, Deadspin published <a href="http://deadspin.com/roger-goodell-failed-so-now-hes-more-powerful-than-eve-1678306843" target="blank">a follow-up story</a> saying, "What's really disturbing about the report is how perfectly its conclusions align with and serve the NFL's interests." The author points out that the conclusion of the report was not that the NFL had too much power in disciplining its players, but that it didn't have enough of it. "A sports league deferring to the wisdom of the criminal justice system is being described as a weakness. This is insane," he wrote." The result, the article says, of the botched investigation by Goodell and the Mueller report is that Goodell and the NFL gained more power than ever.<br /><br />

Deadspin also ran a <a href="http://deadspin.com/meet-the-dunce-ex-cop-who-fucked-up-the-nfls-ray-rice-i-1678339697" target="blank">story on the man who ran the Rice investigation</a>, who Deadspin called a "dunce ex-cop," James Buckley, a private investigator in New Jersey. The story breaks down the emails laid out in the Mueller report, and points out that not one of the emails cited was written by or to Goodell, and most of the investigation is run through Buckley.
