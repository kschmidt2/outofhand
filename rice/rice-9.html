Deadspin did not publish a story with this news, they only shared a tweet from an NFL reporter. <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/04/22/greg-hardy-suspension-dallas-cowboys" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/12742740/greg-hardy-dallas-cowboys-suspended-10-games-nfl" target="blank">ESPN</a> both published straight news stories, with ESPN going a little deeper into the NFL’s investigation, which included a failed attempt to talk to Holder.<br /><br />

The next day, Sports Illustrated’s MMQB column <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2015/04/23/nfl-greg-hardy-the-mmqb-mailbag-nfl-schedule-making" target="blank">published a story</a> discussing how the NFL now punishes players doesn’t rely on criminal convictions to proceed with severe punishments.
