NFL commissioner Roger Goodell sent a memo to team owners announcing new punishments for domestic violence, including a six-game suspension for first-time offenders, and an indefinite ban for repeat offenders. ESPN <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11425532/roger-goodell-letter-nfl-teams-domestic-violence-policy" target="blank">published the full letter</a>, while <a href="http://deadspin.com/nfl-announces-severe-new-penalties-for-domestic-violenc-1628071427" target="blank">Deadspin</a> and <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/08/28/nfl-domestic-violence-policy" target="blank">Sports Illustrated</a> each published summaries.<br /><br />

Additional coverage from Deadspin included <a href="http://deadspin.com/so-whats-actually-new-about-the-nfls-new-domestic-viole-1628098179" target="blank">a post asking what was really new about the new policy</a>. The author, Barry Petchesky, pointed out that the new policy set a minimum suspension of six games, but since there was no minimum suspension before, Goodell could have issued any suspension he wanted. Players are still allowed to appeal to have their suspension reduced. Petchesky argued that nothing had changed, except the NFL got to be seen in the media as being tough on domestic violence.<br /><br />

At SI, Chris Burke <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/08/28/roger-goodell-apology-nfl-domestic-violence-policy" target="blank">wrote a column</a> asking a few questions including at what point would the NFL issue a suspension? Would it wait for trial? Also, how would the players union handle the new policy? He then pointed out that Goodell worked quickly to rectify a mistake he made , though says he should not get a pat on the back for this.
